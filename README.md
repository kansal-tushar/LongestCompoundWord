#Overview:

This Java program, LongestCompoundWord.java, finds the longest compound word and calculates the total number of compound words in a given text file. A compound word is a word formed by combining shorter words from the same file.

#Steps to Execute:

1.Download LongestCompoundWord.java.
2.Ensure you have Java installed.
3.Prepare a text file with words, each separated by a space.
4.Update the file path in LongestCompoundWord.java.
5.Compile with javac LongestCompoundWord.java.
6.Run with java LongestCompoundWord.
7.Check the output for the longest compound word, total compound words, and processing time.

#Design Decisions:

1.Data Structure: Used a Trie for efficient word storage and retrieval.
2.Pair Class: Utilized a simple Pair class to manage word-suffix pairs.
3.Algorithm: Processed words from the file, identifying compound words using a queue-based approach. Used Trie for quick word lookup.
4.Time Measurement: Measured processing time accurately using System.currentTimeMillis().

#Approach:

The program systematically identifies compound words by leveraging a Trie for fast word lookup. It employs a straightforward algorithm to process word-suffix pairs efficiently. The code is clear and well-commented for readability and maintainability.

#Conclusion:

LongestCompoundWord.java provides a simple and effective solution for finding compound words in a text file. Its efficient algorithm and careful design make it suitable for handling large datasets while offering accurate results and insights into processing time.
